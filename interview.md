3: Can you describe a time when you helped create a fun and inclusive atmosphere within a team or workplace? How did this environment impact the team’s collaboration and creativity?
### Sixten
    - The team consisted of Sixten (Chef of the Party), he listened to the chefs and sous-chefs orders, and followed their requirements. For the team spirit, Sixten asked about their past history and education in a restaurant, what dish they like to cook, what hours they prefer working. By asking those questions, Sixten was able to reach a deeper understanding about not just their interests in the kitchen, also in everyday life. 
### Joshua
* - One story was a new person that didn’t have a lot of involvement, they all grouped together and had banter. Tried to bring the new person into the group by asking questions, and help with their questions. To try to create an inclusive atmosphere, make the new person comfortable with the team spirit, which led to their performance in coding improving.
### Carl
* - I worked at a Casino as backup manager. I tried to motivate the team with constructive criticism.
### Jimmy
* - My most recent work at a car-parts warehouse, they were in a bad situation, they were in progress of changing delivery methods to clients, they had lots of complaints. Jimmy is very structured, he fixed the export side of the warehouse, they got fewer complaints over time and orders arrived not broken etc.

### Sixten

### Carl
* - Idea: An idea for the schedule for brake efficiency.
* - Result: Happier team with more fair scheduling.
### Jimmy
* - Same example as above, he taught them Tetris, how to efficiently stack everything. Stuff would break due to heavy wares being on top.
